# Overview

It's the first project from The Odin Project course. I need to make a recipes web site, it looks easy because I already know basic HTML, but I want to follow the courses as it was made to do.

## Languages and Resources

To this project I will be using HTML, mainly lists, but no any kind of css and javascript, as said, it's a basic web site. I am using git in the command line to improve my knowledge too.
